This project is an introduction to Typescript. Our goal was to create a module that uses the Car module created by the teacher.

I created different classes like pilote circuit and season to make it as interesting as possible. Moreover, I've tried my best to incorporate stuff that we saw during class.

I inevitably worked with copilot...

To run the project and look at the results of the ongoing 2025 F13 season, open a terminal, and run these two commands one at a time:
% tsc Main.ts
% node Main.ts

(Make sure you have typescript and node installed).
